								<h3>1.TOPIC</h3>
							<p>Our team has opted to further expand on the function of our Cyber Security. In order to create a safety connection into the internet where people can freely communicate and interact with one another without concerning of the privacy. Humans' propensity for dishonesty is a primary cause of security vulnerabilities. Due to this vulnerability, hackers can trick their victims into clicking on malicious links, allowing them to download malware or provide them with personal information.</p>
							<p>Prior study has investigated the sensitivity of people to large-scale phishing efforts and narrowly focused spear-phishing assaults. This study examines how phishing emails delivered to particular groups affect their vulnerability to exploitation. We investigated whether the structure and content of email communications affected recipients' susceptibility to phishing. The objective of the phishing emails was to elicit either the fear of losing important assets (such as enrollment and aid) or the hope of getting valuable assets (such as enrollment and aid) (e.g., iPad, gift card, social networks).<p>
							<p>The objective of our communications was the contextual exploitation of human weaknesses such as greed, social necessity, etc. Emails were sent to 7225 students, and their responses were recorded. According to the study, phishing was more likely to succeed when emails were tailored to target the psychological weaknesses of receivers. When individuals fear losing something of value or are eager to acquire something of value, phishing and deception are more likely to occur. As a result of our research, a theoretical framework based on the heuristic-systematic processing model has been developed to evaluate the susceptibility of individuals to deception. Using our experiment, we illustrate that several factors impact phishing campaigns. <p>

								<h3>2. Motivation</h3>
								<p>Many of the protocols that make up the Internet's current architecture were established without any regard for security. In the absence of a truly secure architecture, protecting a network becomes increasingly challenging. As a result, the Internet is a constantly changing environment, both in terms of its structure and the technologies that are being developed. Many Internet attacks can be quickly, cheaply, and difficult to detect and track because of its openness and the original design of the protocols. An attacker does not need to be present in order to carry out an attack. A wide variety of cyberattacks can be launched from virtually any point on Earth, making it impossible to determine the identity of the perpetrator. It is not always necessary to "break in" to a website's data or service to undermine its confidentiality, integrity, or accessibility (get privileges on it). <p>
								<p>Despite this, a disproportionate number of websites rely on the Internet for their entire operation. When it comes to trusting the Internet, it is common for websites to be naive or reckless. Data and system dangers may go unnoticed by these individuals. Even if the current security measures are adequate, they may feel their website will not be a target. Over time, solutions become less effective as new tools and techniques are developed by invaders and technology advances. The rapid expansion and use of the network, as well as the rapid implementation of network services involving complex applications, both increase the vulnerability of the Internet. In many cases, these services are not designed to be secure in any way. They rush to get new items out the door without checking for earlier mistakes or new security flaws that could be introduced. <p>
								<p>Because operating system security is rarely taken into account when acquiring a new computer, the problem gets worse. For commercial operating system suppliers, client demand for performance, pricing, usability and maintenance and support are the most important factors in their sales. Operating systems available for purchase are, as a result, shipped in an unprotected state, allowing sites to begin using them right away. These servers/websites are frequently not set up correctly from a security aspect prior to joining. They are subject to attacks that can begin within minutes of connection because of their unsecure architecture. </p>

								<h3>1.Aim:</h3>
								<p>The pandemic has rendered inaccessible a significant portion of our regular services, and working remotely has proven to be challenging for many professions. Therefore, a solution is required to improve the experience of home-based workers. This project's purpose is to construct a safe security system with a user-friendly environment that is unaffected by changes in privacy settings, so allowing users to work, study, and relax from home more effectively. To do this, we must meet the following conditions: </p>

							<header class="major">
								<h3>-Usefulness-</h3>
								<p>Users evaluate the performance and usability of a cybersecurity system while deciding whether to embrace a new technology. Since we aimed to develop an application that non-technical users could easily use, it must be so simple that they only need to do a few steps to open and access the system in order to protect their connection. Consequently, it is imperative that we provide users with clear instructions and images on how to set up the algorithm and protection layers so that the device will function properly, as well as an AI assistant that will accompany and guide the user when they're running our software to help them feel more comfortable with the software and resolve any issues they encounter while using any applications. </p>

								<h3>-Reasonable price-</h3>
								<p>Security applications may be pricey for high-end devices, one of the drawbacks of purchasing one. High-quality materials and cutting-edge electronics in headsets are to blame for the expanded capabilities, such as greater protection and more precise threat tracking that headsets provide. To achieve our aim of increasing the efficiency and productivity of as many people as possible, we want our membership to our cybersecurity program to be offered at a price that everyone can afford without losing quality or functionality. A thorough investigation to identify important data sources is therefore essential for improving the security of our apps. </p>

								<h3>-Remote working problem-</h3>
								<p>During the epidemic, many people found it difficult to adapt to working from home since they were used to working in an office. As a result, the most essential goal of our project is to enhance the remote work experience and remove potential hurdles like poor communication and limited access to services. Consequently, we envisioned an interactive environment where users could log in and converse directly with one another without exposing critical information, making it simpler for them to convey their thoughts and opinions outside of the limits of a computer screen. Additionally, tools provided by the program will also be available to users.  </p>

						<h3>-Distribution-</h3>
					</header>
					<p>The distribution will take place over the course of the subsequent two weeks as we finish off the last of the specifics before mailing over the remaining items. On the other hand, we will want financial support before we can get started. When it comes to participating in Shark Tank Vietnam or Shark Tank Worldwide, respectively, our major objective is to get the attention of "The Sharks" as well as the global audience of the Shark Tank. In the event that all goes according to plan, we will begin shipping our goods to the nations that have been given permission to do so. </p>

						<h3>2.Roles </h3>
					</header>
					<p>Following an in-depth discussion of the project's overarching concept, the next step is to allocate roles and responsibilities to the various participants. The fact that we are able to make full use of the knowledge and experience of our fellow employees while still recognizing the value of the contributions made by each individual is the most essential aspect of this section. To begin, Minh Anh has the option of educating themselves on the cybersecurity outline, obtaining assistance from specialists, or researching all of the potential hardware components on the internet. In addition, in order to give service to the client, I will be responsible for the processing of the platform as well as its development.</p>

						<h3>-Threat Environment-</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Frequently, CISOs neglect to investigate their operating environment. Investing in operational security and social media training should be a top priority for the highest-ranking firm leaders. As the intricacy of cyberattacks develops, cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting information collected from public sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook to conduct whaling assaults. A whale attack is a sort of phishing that targets high-level executives, such as the CEO or CFO, in order to steal critical corporate information. These chief executives are vulnerable to whaling assaults. This may include employee personal information or the organization's financial information. Scammers may masquerade as the chief executive officer (CEO) of a company or other business officials to convince victims to authorize high-value wire transfers to offshore bank accounts or to visit fraudulent websites that install malware on their computers. </p>

						<h3>-Third-vendor risk -</h3>
					</header>
					<p>Using third- and fourth-party suppliers, companies may outsource specific business functions, reducing costs and increasing operational efficiency. A company's most sensitive data, such as the personal identifying information of its customers, is generally accessible to these third-party service providers (PII). Continuous and full network visibility is essential for businesses. Risk management of third parties allows companies to profit from suppliers without sacrificing security. </p>

						<h3>4.Group communication </h3>
					</header>
					<p>In order to successfully collaborate on a project, communication between team members is critical. The most common reason of failure in business is a breakdown in interpersonal communication. Meeting on Microsoft Teams, a web-based platform, is the primary means of communication in this situation. Since the commencement of the project, we have benefited much from this resource. As a result, we utilize Meta, Google Docs, and Microsoft Word for file storage, distribution, and discussion. A minimum of once a week and up to twice a week is the norm for us. While reviewing the quality of the overall report, we often share our unique approaches with each other during our meetings. Then, completion dates for the remaining areas will be set. This is done in order to keep track of who gave what and to ensure that everything is running well. The following week, week 12, we want to do offline sessions to practice our presentation and go over the remainder of our Project report. Whether a team member isn't in regular contact with the rest of the group, we'll try to get in touch with them and check if they're dealing with personal or professional difficulties. It is the team's responsibility to help those who are having difficulty completing a job by providing assistance and reassigning them to simpler duties. It is our responsibility to tell the instructor if a team member with personal issues refuses to interact with the team or participate in team activities. </p>
