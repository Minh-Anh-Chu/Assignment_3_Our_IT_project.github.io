								<h3>VO THANH DAT - S3915261</h3>
							<p>My name is Vo Thanh Dat, you can contact me through s3915261@rmit.edu.vn. First, I attended Monash University as a first-year student before transferring to RMIT University, where I am currently enrolled as a third-year student. International business is my primary concentration. I was born and reared in the province of Binh Duong.</p>
							<p> Gamers and others who like to experiment with new techniques in order to have a better understanding of how technology works are among my favorite pastimes. Concerning my interest in information technology, the first game I played when I was seven years old was Crossfire, which started my early interest in gaming. From then, I explored several other game genres, including MOBA, Gacha, and MMO. To me, games serve as a tool of acquiring soft skills and approaches that can be utilized in real-world situations. I don't have a lot of skills in the information technology field, as IT is not my major. I do, however, have a working knowledge of Python and some experience with terminal tools such as Git Bash or Shell. </p>

								<h3>CHU ANH MINH - S3758870</h3>
								<p>My name is Chu Anh Minh, my student information is s3758870 and s3758870@rmit.edu.vn and I am currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology. I was born and raised in Ha Noi City. I am really into playing video games , basketball , and watching movies . In my daily routine, I usually play games in my free time because it’s a good way for me to communicate with my old friends when we are in different schools now. Since sitting in front of electronic devices all the time is not good, that’s why sometimes I go to the basketball court and have some friendly basketball matches versus other people. About my IT interest, I was always fascinated about how every website, applications or video games that I have experienced worked and the structure behind it. About my experience in the IT field, I had some experience with a few coding languages. Most of my knowledge is about C,C++, Java and Python.  </p>
