								<h3>1.COMMON ELEMENT</h3>
								<p>If we want to study the similarities in our professional aspirations, we need to be proficient in logical thinking as well as programming languages like Python, C, and Java. Only then can we begin our investigation. If any of us are going to have a solid basic understanding, we will need to study these topics both in the classroom and on the internet. Additionally, all of us are able to speak in languages other than our mother tongue, which enables us to conduct business in other countries. It is possible that, as part of our long-term strategy, we will need to concentrate on developing a variety of "soft skills," which include time management, collaboration, and appropriate behavior, in order to be successful in a demanding working environment. </p>

								<h3>2.DIFFERENCES IN THE PROFESSIONAL AIM</h3>
								<p>Mostly due to the fact that our professional goals are so different. Information technology is Minh primary focus at this point in his education. Dat is simply taking an introductory IT course since he wants to increase his grasp of cyber security. His major is in Small Business Management. In addition, to safeguard the business concepts of his organization against the risks of the internet. However, in the context of this project, we may harness our specific talents to complement one another and build a highly innovative and dynamic environment that is computer-generated. In general, we may have a variety of routes to success. <p>

								<h3>3.SUMMARY</h3>
								<p>To summarize, we all desire to follow our aspirations and bring them to fruition as soon as possible. Thus, the essentials on which we should concentrate our efforts are a thorough understanding of the subjects in which we are interested, a bachelor's degree, and self-learning soft skills. Additionally, years of experience in a real-world work environment might significantly improve our comprehension. For the time being, while we are still in school, all we can do is make an effort to study from a variety of sources, seek counsel from alumni and seniors, and be prepared to apply our impending knowledge later in life.  </p>
